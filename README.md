# CryptoClustering
Use Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.


# Features
* Use Sci-Kit Learn's StandardScaler function to normalize the data (all 7 features)
* Using all 7 data features:
    * determine the best number of prediction clusters
    * plot the prediction clusters
* Use Principal Companent Analysis (Sci-Kit Learn PCA module specifically) to reduce the features to the top 3 and:
    * determine the best number of prediction clusters
    * plot the prediction clusters

# Results
Looking at the elbow curve from both methods, four (4) clusters are the optimal breakdown of the provided cryptocurrencies:

The PCA method clusters the data points more tightly clarifying connections within clusters. However, both methods split this dataset in the same way. As you can see below the two outlier groups are the same. Additionally, the members of group 3 of the original data aligns with the members of group 1 in the pca reduction.
